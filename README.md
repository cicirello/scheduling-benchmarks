# scheduling-benchmarks

This repository contains a mirror of a few sets of scheduling problem benchmark instances. I've included links to the original source of the benchmarks, along with any licensing information specific to each benchmark set.  Each directory contains a README with details of the origin of the benchmark as well as details such as format of the files, etc.

## Benchmarks Available

* __Common Due Date Scheduling:__ Directory [/common-due-date](common-due-date) are the benchmark instances for common due date scheduling from OR-Library.
* __Weighted Tardiness Scheduling:__ Directory [/wt](wt) are the benchmark instances for weighted tardiness scheduling from OR-Library.
* __Weighted Tardiness Scheduling with Sequence-Dependent Setups:__ Directory [/wtsds](wtsds) are the benchmark instances for weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setups (Vincent A. Cicirello, 2003).
